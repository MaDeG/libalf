2008, 2009 by David R. Piegdon <david-i2@piegdon.de>


liblangen is a C++ library for generating (regular) languages by means
of finite automata or regular expressions. currently it consists of

	1) an equally distributed DFA generator

	2) a RegEx generator

	3) a NFA generator

	4) an enumerator for DFAs

DEPENCENCIES:

	liblangen only has two dependencies:
	the GNU multiple precision arithmetics library GMP and its C++
	interface (libgmp and libgmpxx).
