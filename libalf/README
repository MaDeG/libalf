DEPENCENCIES:

	libalf is a stand-alone C++ library, no external libraries except
	c++ standard lib and STL are required.

	however, the following libraries may be of help for developing
	applications or are required for some of the testcases:

	1) libAMoRE-1.0 / libAMoRE++ : C/C++ automata library for working
	with finite automata. (both AMoRE-1.0 with some patches and the
	C++ interface currently reside in the subversion repository of
	libalf. the C++ interface has been written during development of
	libalf, but we're currently working on integrating it into the
	original libAMoRE (upstream).)

	2) liblangen (LanguageGenerator) is a library for generating
	(regular) languages in the form of automata or regular expressions.
	it came to existence during the development of libalf and thus
	has the same interfaces for automata. it is useful e.g. for
	generating random automata or regex with specific constraints,
	so algorithms can automatically massively be tested.

	3) MiniSat v1.14 is fully integrated into libalf, as it is
	required for the bierman algorithm.
