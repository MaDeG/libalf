TODO (priority ordered)
====



- set_alphatbet_size

- finish mVCA angluin-like

- Rivest+Shapire Algorithm (improved L*)

- angluin: mealy-machine

- create debian packages

- RPNI: check for correctness

- DeLeTe2: check for correctness

- network code: check network/deserialization code for bugs

- documentation

- THOUGHT: abstract knowledgebase?

- THOUGHT: change knowledgebase-query interface to represent normalizer and remove them
  from algorithm and into knowledgebase?

- knowledgebase: rewrite / check efficiency of equivalence relation

- RPNI: check efficiency

- DeLeTe2: check efficiency

- angluin: check undo and increase_alphabet_size()

- NL*: add normalizer and undo

- NL*: check increase_alphabet_size()

- Bierman: efficient implementation (using DDB instead of MiniSat)

- BL*: implement

- L*,L*col,NL*: use knowledgebase pointers instead of list<int> words.
