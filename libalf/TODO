TODO
====


(priority ordered)


- network protocol: define new network protocol
	(isomorph to JNI, to make switching between JNI and dispatcher easy)

- KVtree: implement

- RPNI: check for correctness

- DeLeTe2: check for correctness

- knowledgebase: rewrite / check efficiency of equivalence relation

- RPNI: check efficiency

- DeLeTe2: check efficiency

- angluin: check undo and increase_alphabet_size()

- documentation

- network code: check network/deserialization code for bugs

- NL*: add (de)serialize, normalizer and undo

- NL*: check increase_alphabet_size()

- Bierman: efficient implementation (using DDB instead of MiniSat)

- BL*: implement

- L*,L*col,NL*: use knowledgebase pointers instead of list<int> words.

- dispatcher: listen on multiple address/port combinations, IPv6 and unix domain sockets
