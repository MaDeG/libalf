TODO
====


(priority ordered)


- Antichains for checking language inclusion and equivalence ( in libAMoRE++ or even upstream? )

- create new network protocol (isomorph to JNI, to make switching between JNI and dispatcher easy)

- KVtree algorithm

- check RPNI for correctness

- check DeLeTe2 for correctness

- rewrite / check efficiency in knowledgebase equivalence relation

- check efficiency in RPNI

- check efficiency in DeLeTe2

- check undo and increase_alphabet_size() in angluin

- documentation (?)

- check network/deserialization code for bugs

- add (de)serialize to NL*

- add normalizer to NL*

- add undo to NL*

- check increase_alphabet_size() in NL*

- efficient Bierman implementation (using DDB instead of MiniSat)

- BL* algorithm

- efficiency in L*, L* col and NL*: use knowledgebase pointers et al

- in AMoRE++: _init and _fini are not working (linker stuff...)

- enable dispatcher to listen on multiple address/port combinations, IPv6 and unix domain sockets
