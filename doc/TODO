(priority ordered)

A)

- RFSA, RFSA- NL* algorithm

- CPU/MEM stats for biermann

- documentation (?)

- integrate oracle into online-algorithms

- JNI, explain Daniel what he needs for that (similar to dispatcher session)

B)

- add normalizer to NL*

- RPNI algorithm

- BL* algorithm

- check network/deserialization code for bugs (or make dispatcher obsolete)

- assistants in knowledgebase (problem: when algorithm works with pointers, either the non-normalized
  does not have a pointer or we need to add it each time something is requested. even for bottom...)

- implement normalizer extension in dispatcher and normalizer

- knowledgebase also without undo/timestamps, to reduce memory footprint

C)

- in learn_regex: check/fix '+' operator in regex on command-line

- enable dispatcher to listen on multiple address/port combinations, IPv6 and unix domain sockets
