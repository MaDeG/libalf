this once was libAMoRE-1.0. it was heavily changed during development of
libalf. several bugs were removed and things renamed. this is NOT an official
release of libAMoRE but a local branch for libalf!


most notable changes:

	* link to a shared library

	* fixed a bug in rex2nfa (off-by-one in ffprerex)

	* fixed a bug in clonenfa (some pointers were cloned instead of
	  the referenced data)

	* rename of some fields in nfauto and dfauto
	  (highest_state and alphabet_size)

	* initial fixes to make the source compile (some extern declaration
	  problems)

	* AMoRE-1.0 cluttered the namespace:
	  it had a `struct set' in nfa2mnfa_types.h. this has been renamed to
	  not conflict with C++'s set-template.

	* remove of required external symbols

	* indentation / code formatting

most notable things NOT changed:

	* newdfa() and newnfa() create a blank new automaton structure
	  (nfauto/dfauto). freedfa() and freenfa() free all data _referenced_ by
	  an automaton structure (nfauto/dfauto), but do not free the structure
	  itself. i personally consider this a bug, but have not fixed it as i
	  do not know if this behaviour is expected internally. so to get rid of
	  an nfauto, you have to freenfa() it and then, if you're working with a
	  pointer (which is reasonable), free it.

	* AMoRE-1.0 still clutterst the namespace:
	  it typedefs `char*' to `string'. this will be removed soon enough.
