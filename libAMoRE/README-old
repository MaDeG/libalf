AMoRE - Automata, Monoid, and Regular Expressions


library part ( libAMoRE )
-------------------------
libAMoRE contains the core data type definitions and algorithms.

To build it, simply type 'make'. This will build a static library 
libAMoRE.a ( I can add a dynamic library target if anybody is interested. ) 
which can be linked with -lAMoRE

To build the documentation, type 'make doc' (you need the 'doxygen' program).

To export the headers, type 'make exportHeaders'

'make install'     will install the library in $LIBDIR/amore
                   (default LIBDIR is /usr/lib)
'make install-docs'will install the docs (default /usr/share/doc/libAMoRE)
                   (default DOCDIR is /usr/share/doc)
'make uninstall'   will undo the effects of the latter two


Remember you can tell 'make' to use other settings, e.g.

make LIBDIR=/home/jdoe/libs DOCDIR=/home/jdoe/docs   \
       HEADER_INSTALLDIR=/home/jdoe/headers


'make clean' removes objects and backup~ files, not the installed files.

libtest.c is used for quick and dirty tests. 'make libtest' builds it.
Take a look for little examples of how the library can be used. You will
quickly be able to build your own automata.


about the source code
---------------------

The code used to be platform independent for a long time, however the
other parts of AMoRE made major restructuring necessary. The resulting code
is known to run on i386 machines and on Linux. Hints about the behaviour
on other OS'es are appreciated. Later versions will make use of automake, 
autoconf, to allow standard targets etc.

Enjoy using libAMoRE.
